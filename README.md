## Simulated Annealing

**Objective:**  
Find the minimum of a mathematical function using a probabilistic technique inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy.

**Key Concepts:**
- Exploration vs. exploitation
- Temperature cooling schedule
- Acceptance probability for worse solutions

**Implemented Function:**  
A multimodal function with several local minima to highlight the strength of simulated annealing in escaping local optima.

## Genetic Algorithms

**Problem:**  
Sailor placement optimization problem.

**Objective:**  
Evolve a population of solutions to optimally place sailors based on defined constraints and fitness criteria.

**Key Concepts:**
- Chromosome encoding
- Selection, crossover, and mutation
- Fitness function evaluation

## Reinforcement Learning

**Problem:**  
Sailor problem, modeled as a Markov Decision Process.

**Objective:**  
Use reward-based learning to find optimal sailor placement or movement decisions in an environment with state transitions.

**Key Concepts:**
- States, actions, and rewards
- Policy learning
- Q-learning / SARSA implementation

## Neural Networks

**Objective:**  
Detect and classify binary classes (class 0 and class 1) using two approaches:

1. **Analytical Approach:**
   - Understanding and visualizing decision regions.
   - Activation functions and weight influence.
   - Manually computing outputs and gradients.

2. **Training Approach:**
   - Model training on labeled data using gradient descent.
   - Performance evaluation (accuracy, loss).
   - Implementation using TensorFlow/Keras or similar frameworks.
